# Pocket Chords

My personal project of guitar chord application. I am learning guitar and it's really great to have all the chords composed online. I think it would be more convenient to have an application where I can search online chords, compose my own ones storing online along with some tools supporting learning guitar.

My upcoming features list will be:

1. Search online chords with song name, artist, composer, genre, and melody. I am only support Vietnamese songs so far.
2. Tools to compose my own ones, and store it online.
3. Song chords tuning, up or down to another tone.
4. Auto-scrolling when viewing a song, with multi pace.
5. Sharing song chords.
6. Exporting to file e.g pdf, text etc...

This application is built on android platform. In fact, this project is for me to learn android.
